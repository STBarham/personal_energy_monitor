# personal_energy_monitor
This project helps students monitor the energy consumption of personal USB devices, revealing both active and standby (phantom) loads. By estimating daily usage costs, it promotes awareness of how routine electrical habits contribute to monthly and yearly energy bills.

## 🧠 Overview

This project measures real-time voltage and current from USB devices to calculate average power usage and estimate daily energy consumption and cost by calibrating test results to user's inputs. The goal is to promote energy awareness among students by giving them direct insight into how much electricity their daily-use devices consume.

## 🔌 Hardware Setup

- Raspberry Pi Pico running MicroPython
- INA219 voltage & current sensor
- USB male & female breakout boards
- Breadboard, jumper wires
- Push button for session control

See [Schematic](hardware/schematic.png)
See [Parts List](hardware/parts_list.md)

## 🖥 Software Workflow

### Microcontroller (Pico):
- Reads data from INA219
- Starts/stops session with button
- Generates CSV containting test data

### PC-side Python Script:
- Receives and logs power data from CSV
- Prompts for device name & usage time
- Calculates energy (Wh/kWh) and cost
- Generates txt report containing user specific results

  ## Sample Output

The following are sample files  generated by the system:

📄 [Raw Power Data (CSV)](report_examples/raw_power_data_sample.csv)  
📄 [Final Report (TXT)](report_examples/daily_energy_report_sample.txt)  
🖼️ ![Energy Usage Plot](report_examples/daily_energy_plot.png)

##  How to Use

1. Wire up the hardware as shown in the schematic.
2. Flash `main.py` and `ina219.py` to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
3. Press the button to start measuring a USB-powered device.
4. Press the button again and unplug device from male breakout board to measure phantom load
5. Open CSV file and read delay time (first line of CSV)
6. Run the PC-side Python script to:
   - Input device name and usage time
   - Automatically generate a usage report
7. View report and plot in `reports/` folder.

##  Future Improvements

- Compute total energy consumption from all devices tested
- Compare total yearly consumption to a sustainability standard per person
- Indicate the percentage by which users are below/above a sustainable consumption
- Provide awareness regarding energy consumption
